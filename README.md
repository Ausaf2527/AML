In this project focused on financial fraud detection, I developed a machine learning framework to identify fraudulent transactions in a synthetic banking dataset with over 6 million records. I used Python for the entire process, from data preprocessing and manipulation with libraries like Pandas and NumPy to visualizing transaction patterns with Matplotlib and Seaborn. To tackle the issue of data imbalance, I applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which improved the model's ability to detect fraud. I then tested five different supervised learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian Naive Bayes—evaluating them based on precision, recall, and AUC-ROC metrics. The framework ultimately achieved over 90% accuracy, showing its potential for practical use in fintech applications.
